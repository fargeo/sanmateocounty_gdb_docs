Arches installs with a few default basemaps that you can choose for your project, or you can add your own basemaps through the command line. One basemap will always be applied to your project's map along with any number of overlays. You can view and manage your active basemaps, overlays, and resource layers from the 'Map Layer Manager' ![Map Layer Manager Tab]({{site.url}}/assets/images/mapManagerTab.PNG) tab.

You can change the active basemap from the search tab by clicking the ![Purple gear]({{site.url}}/assets/images/purpleGear.PNG) at the top of the map window. From this map layer menu you can select a new basemap to instantly replace the active one.
