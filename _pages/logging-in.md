Upon connecting to an Arches instance, you will be presented with the Arches homepage, which will look something like this:
![Homepage]({{site.url}}/assets/images/archesHome.PNG)

From the homepage, click ![Login]({{site.url}}/assets/images/loginButton.PNG) in the upper right hand corner and you will be taken to the sign in page. If an administrator has already set up your account, simply enter your credentials and sign in to start using Arches. If you don't yet have an account, click ![Create a new account]({{site.url}}/assets/images/newAccountButton.PNG) to get started.

**Tip:**
You can change your password and edit other account details from the 'Profile Manager' ![Profile manager]({{site.url}}/assets/images/profileManager.PNG) tab at any time.
