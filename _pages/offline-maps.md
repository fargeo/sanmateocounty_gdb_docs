 You can set up offline maps to serve as a basemap for your Aches Collector users when they are unable to connect to the internet while gathering data. To do this, you will need an MBTiles file that holds a collection of tilesets. You can create a MBTiles file with you own data for your project or download a premade file from a site like [OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.com).
