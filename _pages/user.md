## What can end users do with Arches?
Arches is designed for end users to easily search, explore, and download resources directly. By design, the Arches framework hides the complex technicalities of a data management system, creating an accessible, user-friendly interface. Our User Guide includes step-by-step instruction for initial Arches set up and basic functionalities. 

## User FAQs
***Do Arches users have to be trained GIS specialists in order to use the system?***  
No. Although Arches allows users to create and edit GIS data, we have developed a user interface that shields users from much of the complexity usually associated with GIS software.

***Does Arches use Esri GIS?***  
No, Arches does not require any Esri software. Esri software requires users to purchase expensive software licenses, which we believe would limit the ability of many organizations to deploy Arches. Instead, Arches uses robust, well-supported, and technologically advanced Open Source alternatives to Esri software.

***Does Arches work on smartphones or tablets?***  
Yes â€“ provided that you have an internet connection. The Arches user interface has been designed for display on screens of all sizes.

***Can images be attached to records?***  
Yes! Users are able to upload images to your Arches database and associate them with existing records. What is more, images that you upload to Arches are treated as resources in their own right. This means that you can add or edit information about them and relate them to any number of resources without needing to upload them again.
