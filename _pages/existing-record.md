Existing records can be opened from the search tab to be viewed and edited. You can select a record to edit from the list on the left or click a resource marker on the map and select the ![Edit button]({{site.url}}/assets/images/editButton.png) button from the window that opens to display the record.

The card tree of whichever record you choose to edit will be shown on the left, similarly to when you are creating a new record. You can navigate to any blank card and enter new data by clicking ![Add]({{site.url}}/assets/images/addButton.PNG) the same as you would when creating a new record.

You can also edit already entered data by going to the created card, editing the entered information, and clicking the ![Save Edit Button]({{site.url}}/assets/images/saveEditButton.PNG) button.

The ![Manage menu]({{site.url}}/assets/images/manageMenu.PNG) menu in the upper left hand corner of the resource editor has some convenient options when dealing with an existing record. From here you can view the resource report, print the resource report, review the resource's edit history, and even copy or delete the resource.
# Copying a Record  
An existing record can also be copied to make a new identical instance of the resource that can be edited. Open the resource you want to copy in the resource editor and click ![Manage menu]({{site.url}}/assets/images/manageMenu.PNG) in the upper left. From there, select 'Copy Resource' to create a duplicate of the record that you can find and open from search. If you need to create a new resource that shares most of its data with an already existing resource, this can be a very efficient way to start it.
