Overlays are added in the same manner as basemaps and are a way to include map layers from external sources to your project's map. Overlays can be applied and hidden from the layer menu on the search tab, which is opened by clicking on the ![Purple gear]({{site.url}}/assets/images/purpleGear.PNG) at the top of the map window. You can apply any number of overlays to your map from here, and adjust their opacity using the slider under each layer.
