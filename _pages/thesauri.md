All controlled vocabularies within Arches, from simple wordlists to complex thesauri, are defined and constructed as concept schemes. Thesauri are multi-level controlled vocabularies that relate a large number of concepts hierarchically. In addition to hierarchical relationships, thesauri allow you to relate concepts associatively, connecting multiple hierarchies to create a more broad and dynamic controlled vocabulary. Thesauri also allow for the definition of polyhierarchical relations, in which a child node can have more than one parent. Thesauri can be imported from outside sources and exported to be used in other projects. To get started on creating your own concept schemes and for help navigating the Reference Data Manager, check out our documentation on the RDM and concept schemes [here](https://arches.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rdm/).

Here you can see an example of a complex thesaurus built out of many concepts:
