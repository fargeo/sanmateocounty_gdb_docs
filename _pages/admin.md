## Administrator FAQs
***We would like to be able to share some information with the public, but also hide some sensitive data that we donâ€™t want to be publicly available. Can we do that using Arches?***  
Yes! Arches allows extremely granular control over which users or groups of users (such as the general public) have access to specific items of information.  A system administrator is able to further define on a field-by-field level the data that users have access to, for example, depending on their login credentials.

***If it is a requirement to be able to make a version of our repository available to the public over the internet, can we do that using Arches?***  
Yes! Arches provides many intuitive ways for the public to search the data that you make available online and to access information related to heritage places.

***If it is a requirement that only staff of our organization have access to our repository, can we still use Arches?***  
Yes! An organization can set up Arches for internal use and access only.
